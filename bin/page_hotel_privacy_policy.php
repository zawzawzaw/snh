              <p>The type of information that we collect from you will depend on the products and services you require. We may collect and hold a range of different information about you. This can include your name, date of birth, contact details (including address, email address, phone number or mobile telephone number), credit card details, occupation, identity card number, driver's licence number, passport number, username or password and information about how you use our products and services.</p>

              <h3>How We Collect Information</h3>
              <p>You may choose to submit information to us when you elect to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make a booking or place an order with us</li>
                <li>Request information, prices or rates be sent to you</li>

                <li>Apply for or request further information on any of the guest loyalty, rewards or marketing programmes that we administer</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This is not an exhaustive list. For example, we may sometimes need to collect additional information where you chose to supply information to us or provide us information by entering into a competition or promotion, participating in a survey, subscribing to our mailing list or registering as a member with us. If you do not provide certain personal information when requested, you may not be able to take advantage of selected services. </p>
              <p>We usually only retain unsolicited information about our guests when dealing with a guest enquiry or complaint or where we conduct an investigation. For example, your image may be present on CCTV footage that also records a fall of another guest in one of our hotels.</p>
